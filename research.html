            Abstract: This paper studies the mechanics of shocks to the supply and demand for dollar reserve-assets (dollar flows) in small open-economies. In small open-economies, the domestic financial system issues dollar liabilities that enable international transactions. To provide that service, the financial system maintains dollar reserve assets that settle international payments done with their liabilities. The supply of reserve assets can increase with surprises in the current account. The demand for reserves can increase when domestic liquidity risks increase. We instrument for dollar demand and supply shocks and estimate the impulse responses of the composition of the financial system's balance sheet, the exchange rate, interest rates, and macroeconomic variables for a small-open economy, Peru. We then present a model consistent with these impulse responses. The model rationalizes the joint control of inflation and exchange-rates in small-open economies. We produce counterfactuals that shed light on the desirability of exchange rate interventions.

            Abstract: Although numerous studies have examined the crowding-out effect of housing on stock holdings via the house price risk channel and the liquidity constraint channel concurrently, separate influences on the crowding-out effect via the two channels have received less attention. In this paper, by exploiting a unique Korean housing tenure type called jeonse, which affects a household's investment decision only through the liquidity constraint channel, I study both effects separately. A calibrated life-cycle portfolio choice model with endogenous housing tenure choice and stock market participation shows that the liquidity constraint channel only affects young households and households with a low net wealth-to-income ratio and does not affect old or wealthier households. The house price risk channel, on the other hand, affects all types of households, including households with a high wealth-to-income ratio. Regressions using a household level panel survey show that the crowding-out effect of jeonse exists only for households with a low net wealth-to-income ratio and young households, whereas the crowding-out effect of homeownership affects all types of households.

            Abstract: Regional decline is a universal phenomenon every rapidly growing countries are experiencing. In this paper, we study the potential role of land-use policy not only as a cure but also as a cause for regional decline. By analyzing South Korea via the general equilibrium spatial growth model in Herkenhoff Ohanian Prescott 2018, we study the effect of land-use policies on regional economies. By affecting the land supply, land policies affect the housing prices. Under the spatial equilibrium condition, such changed housing prices reallocate population to the region with lower housing prices, exacerbating or alleviating the regional decline. Land-use restrictions are more lenient in Seoul Metropolitan Area. If government introduces tighter land-use restrictions in Seoul Metropolitan Area and relax land-use restrictions in other regions, regional population more evenly distributes at the cost of aggregate GDP loss and universal housing price increases. It is shown that South Korea's 2nd New Town Project exacerbated the regional decline by decreasing overall rural population share by 4%. However, it was cost effective as it increased steady state value of real aggregate GDP flow by 0.4% permanently with one-time cost amounting 4.05% of real aggregate GDP.
