          <strong>Abstract</strong>: This study aims to address this research gap by utilizing Eurostat Purchasing Power Parity data and a two-country DSGE model that incorporates realistic housing sectors. Housing rent represents the most substantial component of household expenditures. Its unique characteristics, including inelastic supply and its reliance on land as a critical production input, distinguish housing services from other goods and services. Despite its distinct importance and attributes, the role of housing rents in international business cycles remains largely unexplored. My empirical analysis reveals that relative housing rent exhibits significant volatility, and more than half of the Backus-Smith correlation and Balassa Samuelson effect observed among Eurozone countries can be attributed to variations in relative housing rents. To generate such large volatility in relative rents and Backus-Smith correlation via relative housing rents, incomplete market is necessary, especially when the productivity shocks are employed. Model simulations demonstrate that the distinctive characteristics of the housing sector, such as its inelastic supply, substantial expenditure weight, and dependence on land, amplify the impact of productivity shocks in the tradable sector while dampening those in the nontradable sector. This enhancement contributes to improved predictions of the Backus-Smith correlation and the Balassa Samuelson effect within the model.

            Abstract: This paper studies the mechanics of shocks to the supply and demand for dollar reserve-assets (dollar flows) in small open-economies. In small open-economies, the domestic financial system issues dollar liabilities that enable international transactions. To provide that service, the financial system maintains dollar reserve assets that settle international payments done with their liabilities. The supply of reserve assets can increase with surprises in the current account. The demand for reserves can increase when domestic liquidity risks increase. We instrument for dollar demand and supply shocks and estimate the impulse responses of the composition of the financial system's balance sheet, the exchange rate, interest rates, and macroeconomic variables for a small-open economy, Peru. We then present a model consistent with these impulse responses. The model rationalizes the joint control of inflation and exchange-rates in small-open economies. We produce counterfactuals that shed light on the desirability of exchange rate interventions.

            Abstract: Although numerous studies have examined the crowding-out effect of housing on stock holdings via the house price risk channel and the liquidity constraint channel concurrently, separate influences on the crowding-out effect via the two channels have received less attention. In this paper, by exploiting a unique Korean housing tenure type called jeonse, which affects a household's investment decision only through the liquidity constraint channel, I study both effects separately. A calibrated life-cycle portfolio choice model with endogenous housing tenure choice and stock market participation shows that the liquidity constraint channel only affects young households and households with a low net wealth-to-income ratio and does not affect old or wealthier households. The house price risk channel, on the other hand, affects all types of households, including households with a high wealth-to-income ratio. Regressions using a household level panel survey show that the crowding-out effect of jeonse exists only for households with a low net wealth-to-income ratio and young households, whereas the crowding-out effect of homeownership affects all types of households.

            Abstract: This paper explores the effect of two different types of land use policies on regional economies by using regional level data of South Korea. We analyze the effect of conventional land-use restrictions in existing cities as well as the effect of unique land-supply policies, motivated by the South Korean governmentâ€™s 2nd New Town Project which built new cities from the scratch, supplying 666,000 houses near Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). We estimate the effect of such policies on the aggregate and regional economies, considering both the efficiency gain from the resource reallocation and externalities from regional decline. If the government introduces tighter land-use restrictions in SMA and relaxes land-use restrictions in other regions, regional population will more evenly distribute at the cost of aggregate GDP loss and universal housing price increases. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the 2nd New Town Project was cost effective as it permanently increased steady state real aggregate GDP flow by 0.4%, for the one-time cost amounting 4.05% of GDP. It however exacerbated regional decline by decreasing overall rural population share by 4%
