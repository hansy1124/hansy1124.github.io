            This paper studies the mechanics of shocks to the supply and demand for dollar reserve-assets (dollar flows) in small open-economies. In small open-economies, the domestic financial system issues dollar liabilities that enable international transactions. To provide that service, the financial system maintains dollar reserve assets that settle international payments done with their liabilities. The supply of reserve assets can increase with surprises in the current account. The demand for reserves can increase when domestic liquidity risks increase. We instrument for dollar demand and supply shocks and estimate the impulse responses of the composition of the financial system's balance sheet, the exchange rate, interest rates, and macroeconomic variables for a small-open economy, Peru. We then present a model consistent with these impulse responses. The model rationalizes the joint control of inflation and exchange-rates in small-open economies. We produce counterfactuals that shed light on the desirability of exchange rate interventions.
