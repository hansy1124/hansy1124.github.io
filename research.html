                                This study aims to address this research gap by utilizing Eurostat Purchasing Power Parity data and a two-country DSGE model that incorporates realistic housing sectors. Housing rent represents the most substantial component of household expenditures. Its unique characteristics, including inelastic supply and its reliance on land as a critical production input, distinguish housing services from other goods and services. Despite its distinct importance and attributes, the role of housing rents in international business cycles remains largely unexplored. My empirical analysis reveals that relative housing rent exhibits significant volatility, and more than half of the Backus-Smith correlation and Balassa Samuelson effect observed among Eurozone countries can be attributed to variations in relative housing rents. To generate such large volatility in relative rents and Backus-Smith correlation via relative housing rents, incomplete market is necessary, especially when the productivity shocks are employed. Model simulations demonstrate that the distinctive characteristics of the housing sector, such as its inelastic supply, substantial expenditure weight, and dependence on land, amplify the impact of productivity shocks in the tradable sector while dampening those in the nontradable sector. This enhancement contributes to improved predictions of the Backus-Smith correlation and the Balassa Samuelson effect within the model.
